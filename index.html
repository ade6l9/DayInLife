            <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
            <p>I wake up at 6:30 AM, stretch, and check my phone to plan my day. After a quick shower, I get ready and head out to catch the ferry and train to work. On the way, I grab a muffin from the coffee cart outside the office before logging in, checking my emails, and reviewing my calendar for updates on my current projects.</p>

            <h2>Work & Study Schedule</h2>
            <p>My work schedule runs from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, where I stay on top of projects, meetings, and deadlines. Once work is done, I transition into my student life with classes from 5:30 PM to 8:00 PM. I prefer taking handwritten notes and mentally keeping track of assignments, but for bigger tasks, I jot them down on my notepad to stay organized.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Work Environment</h2>
            <p>I have carefully set up my home workspace to be both comfortable and productive. While I work from the office during the day, I prefer studying and coding at home in an environment that helps me stay focused. Taking short breaks between tasks keeps me grounded and motivated.</p>

    <section class="section grid-layout" id="social-alone">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Personal & Social Time</h2>
            <p>I balance my time between socializing and recharging alone. After long work and study hours, I appreciate quiet moments to unwind. On weekends, I prioritize social time—whether it's spending time with my fiancé, catching up with friends, or attending family gatherings. When it comes to meals, I enjoy a mix of solo dining during the week and shared meals on special occasions.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Unwinding & Hobbies</h2>
            <p>To relax, I enjoy watching shows while having dinner and reading before bed. When time allows, I dive into hobbies like story-driven games and 3D printing projects. I value my time spent with my fiancé, family, and friends, as that’s where I feel the most fulfilled.</p>

    <section class="section grid-layout" id="coding">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Coding & Productivity</h2>
            <p>I dedicate 1-2 hours daily to coding, usually at night when everything else is done. When deadlines are tight, I push through with minimal breaks, but when possible, I take short walks or watch an episode of a show to reset before jumping back in.</p>

            <h2>End of Day & Sleep Routine</h2>
            <p>Evenings depend on the demands of the day. If I’ve had a long work and study session, I enjoy a quiet night, perhaps reading or catching up on a personal project. On ideal days, I love spending quality time with my fiancé, whether that’s going out to a restaurant we love or trying somewhere new. Sleep is still a work in progress, but I try to wrap up my day on a restful note.</p>
